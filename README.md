# Experiments-on-extracting-key-acpects-of-text-reviews
In this project we will test different NLP tools in order to extract key aspecs of text reviews.  
The tools include: RuBERT for Sentiment Analysis, CountVectorizer, TF-IDF, RAKE, KeyBERT, LDA, T5.  
Supportive tools: Mystem, regex, t-SNE, Word2Vec.  
We will run our experiments on reviews from the [Yandex Geo Reviews Dataset 2023] (https://github.com/yandex/geo-reviews-dataset-2023/blob/master/README.md)
